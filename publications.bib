	abstract = {This paper focuses on random uplink transmissions of a subset of nodes disseminated in a cell. Under the constraints of massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in cellular Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), improving the capability of a receiver to detect simultaneously several transmissions with a high probability is important. Considering a very limited coordination between the receiver and the distributed transmitters, the usage of coded Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) strategies is seducing. In this framework, we target synchronous direct data transmissions and propose an optimal detector of the active users with channel state information at the receiver limited to statistical knowledge. This algorithm is based on a Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, under statistical channel knowledge only. We give the formulation of the optimal detector and we evaluate its performance, with different codelengths, code types (random Gaussian and Grassmannian codes) and for various number of antennas at the base station.},

	abstract = {Despite the huge number of contributions dealing with the evaluation of cellular networks performance, tackling with more and more complex systems including multi-tier networks or MIMO systems, the fundamental limits in terms of capacity in an information theory sense is not known for these networks. Stochastic geometry helped doing a step forward, relying on Palm theory and providing coverage statistic at the network scale. However, this statistic is not sufficient to establish a fundamental limit, namely to characterise a Shannon capacity region of the network. In this paper, we propose a new approach exploiting the cell capacity of the Spatial Continuum Broadcast Channel (SCBC) recently introduced for an isolated cell. The network capacity is linked to the cells’ geometry statistics in a Voronoi tessellation. The fundamental limit is characterised by the minimal average cell power required in a network modelled as a Point Process (PP) to achieve a desired rate distribution. A direct relation is established between this minimum average power and the partial area statistics of the cells geometry, which constitute a sufficient statistic. Our approach is validated through Monte-Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {As industrial plants increase the number of wirelessly connected sensors for fault detection, a key problem is to identify and obtain data from the sensors. Due to the large number of sensors, random access protocols exploiting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are a natural approach. In this paper, we develop new algorithms based on approximate message passing for sensor identification and channel estimation accounting for correlation in the activity probability of each sensor and observations of physical variables (e.g., temperature) by the access point. These algorithms form the basis for data decoding, while also identifying faulty machines and estimating local values of the temperature, which can lead to a reduction in the amount of data required to be transmitted. Numerical results show that for an expected activity probability of 0.35, our algorithms improve the normalized mean-square error of the channel estimate by up to 5dB and reduce the rate of sensor identification errors by a factor of four.},

	title = {Activity models and {Bayesian} estimation algorithms for wireless grant-free random access},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-03871656},
	abstract = {The new 5G’s wireless networks have started to be deployed all around the world. With them, a large spectrum of services are about to emerge, resulting in new stringent requirements so that 5G targets performances exceed that of 4G by a factor of 10. The services are enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra reliable and low-latency communication (uRLLC) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) where each of which has required the ongoing development of key new technologies. Many of these technologies will also play an important role in the emergence of 6G. In this thesis, the focus is on grant-free RA (GFRA) as an enabler of uRLLC and mMTC. GFRA is a new protocol introduced in 5G new radio (5G-NR) for reducing the data overhead of the random access (RA) procedure. This results in a significant reduction in the latencies of the user equipments (UEs) access to a connected medium via an access point (AP). Achieving efficient GFRA is of key importance for many 5G applications, e.g. for large scale internet of things (IoT) wireless networks. The study of new non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) signal processing techniques is then considered. Using tools from the theory of Bayesian compressed sensing (CS), algorithms within the family of approximate message passing (AMP) are developed to address the joint active user detection and channel estimation (AUDaCE) problem. It is crucial to properly identify transmitting UEs and guarantee that an AP can reliably transmit back data to the detected UEs. In contrast to existing work on this topic, the AUDaCE is studied for wireless networks where the activity of the UEs is correlated. To this end, two activity models are introduced. The first one models the activity of the UEs in the network with group-homogeneous activity (GHomA). The second model accounts for more general dependence structure via group-heterogeneous activity (GHetA). Approximate message passing algorithms within the hybrid GAMP (HGAMP) framework are developed for each of the models. With the aid of latent variables associated to each group for modeling the activity probabilities of the UEs, the GHomA-HGAMP algorithm can perform AUDaCE for GFRA leveraging such a group homogeneity. When the activity is heterogenous, it is possible to develop GHetA-HGAMP using the copula theory. Extensive numerical studies are performed, which highlight significant performance improvements of GHomA-HGAMP and GHetA-HGAMP over existing algorithms which do not properly account for correlated activity. In particular, the channel estimation and active user detection capability are enhanced in many scenarios with up to a 4dB improvement with twice less user errors. As a whole, this thesis provides a systematic approach to AUDaCE for wireless networks with correlated activities using Bayesian CS.},

	abstract = {Industrial IoT (IIoT) is one of the major verticals targeted by the next generations of wireless networks. In order to provide industrial plants with features relying on wireless communications, the grant-free RA (GFRA) protocol appears to be a promising means for supporting massive ultra-reliable connectivity; at the same time, it is a critical bottleneck that requires an access point (AP) to be able to jointly perform active user detection and channel estimation (AUDaCE) to fulfill its main mission of allowing industrial wireless devices to access the core network. This mission is even harder when the GFRA requests are correlated because of event-driven activity triggers. This paper proposes a new tractable gaussian correlated activity (GCA) model for this scenario. The corresponding AUDaCE problem is then studied in the Bayesian compressed sensing (BCS) framework. An hybrid instance of the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm is derived and its capability to perform AUDaCE is numerically assessed by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The numerical results show gains of 2.5dB in channel estimation gain for twice less detection errors w.r.t. state-of-theart algorithms.},

	abstract = {In grant-free random access, a key question is how devices should utilize resources without coordination. One standard solution to this problem are strategies where devices randomly select time-slots based on an optimized stochastic allocation rule. However, the optimization of this allocation rule requires accurate knowledge of which devices have been active in previous frames. As user identification algorithms are subject to errors, the expected throughput of the optimized allocation can be highly suboptimal. In this paper, we propose algorithms for optimization of device time-slot allocations that mitigate the impact of user identification errors. We show that when the activity distribution with and without errors is known, then our algorithm converges with probability one to a stationary point. When the activity distributions are not available, we introduce new theoretically-motivated heuristics which significantly improve the expected throughput over existing algorithms and approach the performance when errors are not present.},
