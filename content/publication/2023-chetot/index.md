abstract: Industrial IoT (IIoT) is one of the major verticals targeted by the next
  generations of wireless networks. In order to provide industrial plants with features
  relying on wireless communications, the grant-free RA (GFRA) protocol appears to
  be a promising means for supporting massive ultra-reliable connectivity; at the
  same time, it is a critical bottleneck that requires an access point (AP) to be
  able to jointly perform active user detection and channel estimation (AUDaCE) to
  fulfill its main mission of allowing industrial wireless devices to access the core
  network. This mission is even harder when the GFRA requests are correlated because
  of event-driven activity triggers. This paper proposes a new tractable gaussian
  correlated activity (GCA) model for this scenario. The corresponding AUDaCE problem
  is then studied in the Bayesian compressed sensing (BCS) framework. An hybrid instance
  of the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm is derived and its capability to perform
  AUDaCE is numerically assessed by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The numerical
  results show gains of 2.5dB in channel estimation gain for twice less detection
  errors w.r.t. state-of-theart algorithms.
