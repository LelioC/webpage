abstract: This paper focuses on random uplink transmissions of a subset of nodes disseminated
  in a cell. Under the constraints of massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in
  cellular Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
  (URLLC), improving the capability of a receiver to detect simultaneously several
  transmissions with a high probability is important. Considering a very limited coordination
  between the receiver and the distributed transmitters, the usage of coded Non Orthogonal
  Multiple Access (NOMA) strategies is seducing. In this framework, we target synchronous
  direct data transmissions and propose an optimal detector of the active users with
  channel state information at the receiver limited to statistical knowledge. This
  algorithm is based on a Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, under statistical channel
  knowledge only. We give the formulation of the optimal detector and we evaluate
  its performance, with different codelengths, code types (random Gaussian and Grassmannian
  codes) and for various number of antennas at the base station.
