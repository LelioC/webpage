abstract: As industrial plants increase the number of wirelessly connected sensors
  for fault detection, a key problem is to identify and obtain data from the sensors.
  Due to the large number of sensors, random access protocols exploiting non-orthogonal
  multiple access (NOMA) are a natural approach. In this paper, we develop new algorithms
  based on approximate message passing for sensor identification and channel estimation
  accounting for correlation in the activity probability of each sensor and observations
  of physical variables (e.g., temperature) by the access point. These algorithms
  form the basis for data decoding, while also identifying faulty machines and estimating
  local values of the temperature, which can lead to a reduction in the amount of
  data required to be transmitted. Numerical results show that for an expected activity
  probability of 0.35, our algorithms improve the normalized mean-square error of
  the channel estimate by up to 5dB and reduce the rate of sensor identification errors
  by a factor of four.
