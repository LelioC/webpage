abstract: In MAC protocols like Aloha, a key question is how devices should utilize
  resources (time slots) without coordination. One standard solution is to assume
  that all users are equally likely to be active and thus consists in picking uniformly
  at random a resource when a device needs to transmit. In practice, all devices are
  not equally likely to transmit, thus it is interesting to consider non-uniform resource
  allocation in order to increase the performances of the network.
