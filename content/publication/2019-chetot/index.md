abstract: Despite the huge number of contributions dealing with the evaluation of
  cellular networks performance, tackling with more and more complex systems including
  multi-tier networks or MIMO systems, the fundamental limits in terms of capacity
  in an information theory sense is not known for these networks. Stochastic geometry
  helped doing a step forward, relying on Palm theory and providing coverage statistic
  at the network scale. However, this statistic is not sufficient to establish a fundamental
  limit, namely to characterise a Shannon capacity region of the network. In this
  paper, we propose a new approach exploiting the cell capacity of the Spatial Continuum
  Broadcast Channel (SCBC) recently introduced for an isolated cell. The network capacity
  is linked to the cellsâ€™ geometry statistics in a Voronoi tessellation. The fundamental
  limit is characterised by the minimal average cell power required in a network modelled
  as a Point Process (PP) to achieve a desired rate distribution. A direct relation
  is established between this minimum average power and the partial area statistics
  of the cells geometry, which constitute a sufficient statistic. Our approach is
  validated through Monte-Carlo simulations.
