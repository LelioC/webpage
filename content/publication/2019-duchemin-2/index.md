abstract: This paper focuses on random uplink transmissions of a subset of nodes disseminated
  in a cell. Under the constraints of massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in
  cellular Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
  (URLLC), we assume a highly restricted coordination with the receiver and the usage
  of coded Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). We then target direct data transmission
  and propose an optimal detector of the active users with channel state information
  at the receiver limited to statistical knowledge. This algorithm implements a Maximum
  Likelihood (ML) detector. We give the formulation of the optimal detector and we
  evaluate its performance, with diﬀerent codelengths and for various number of base
  station antennas.
